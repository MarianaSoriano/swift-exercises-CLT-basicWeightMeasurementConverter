Doing:
  ☐ Studing loops and nested loops in Swift
To Do:
  ☐ Use a loop to avoid to exit from Functions until user choose it @high
Done:
  ✔ ✘ Try "repeat-while" loop, if it evaluates to false the execution terminates ✘ I tried but it has not worked as expected @done(19-03-21 11:43)
  ✔ Solve "cannot convert value of type 'String' to expected argument type 'Bool' " issue @done(19-03-14 13:02)
  ✔ Is there an "until" loop in Swift? Investigate ✍ No, it doesn't exist but I can use "repeat-while" loop @done(19-03-13 11:30) 
  ✔ Create functions with converter code and call them in the general conditional @done(19-03-13 11:07)
  ✔ Put converters code into coditionals: If "C" so execute "Centimeters Converter" @done(19-03-13 11:00)
  ✔ 2 user inputs, the same code execution: How to deal with "C" and "c" inputs? to trigger Centimeters Converter Code ✍ || "or" Logical Operator @done(19-03-08 16:47)
  ✔ At the beginning, ask user wich measure do they want to convert: inches or centimeters and executing the corresponding code @done(19-03-13 11:09)
  ✔ Create a Conditional Statement to execute corresponding code: inches or centimeters @critical @done(19-03-08 16:26)
  ✔ Solve "incorrect" user's input issue. What happens if the user doesn't give a number as input? @high @done(19-03-06 11:21)
  ✔ Convert `inputIn` var into an *Integer* and use it in `fromInToCm` var @high @done(19-03-04 13:14)
  ✔ Ask the user their values via readLine() function in my CommandLine Tool @done(19-03-02 18:54)
